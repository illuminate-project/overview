# Illuminate

Illuminate is a photo relighting app for iOS and Android devices. It works by generating a depth map from a photo, which is then used to create a 3D mesh. This model is then loaded into a scene where lights can be added, with the results being shown to the user in real time.

Illuminate was created as a Senior Design project at the University of Central Florida. It was nominated as a semi-finalist at the Spring 2023 showcase.
